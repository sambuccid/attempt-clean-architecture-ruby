# Attempt to Clean Architecture in Ruby
This is a project I used to try to apply Clean Architecture principles, hopefully it can give a starting point and an example to other people learning this principles.

# Migrated
All the code in this project, including the original README, has been migrated to Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/sambuccid/learning-clean-architecture-ruby
